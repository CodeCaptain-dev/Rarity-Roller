# Rarity-Roller
ðŸŽ² RARITY ROLLER ðŸŽ²
A simple luck-based game where each roll has a 50% chance to level up your rarity. Start at Basic and try to climb through Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, and Mythic. The higher you go, the harder it gets. Just press a key and roll.

Instructions:
Press R and Enter to roll, but it's recommended to hold Enter.
Most of the time, you'll get a low-tier rarity, but occasionally, you might land something amazing like Legendary or Mythic.
There are also other secret rarities you may discover.

# Here are the list of rarities (excluding secret rarities):
Basic 50%
Common 50%
Uncommon 25%
Rare 12.5%
Super Rare 6.25%
Epic 3.12%
Legendary 1.56%
Mythic 0.78%

# EDIT: 
I did not notice Matthew-Mar-GH's roller when making this, check their roller out too.
